# ThemeHelper
This is just a small project I made for myself and then thought other people might find it useful, it lets you apply and stack transformations to colours.
---
This program will simply let you type in a colour in the left textbox (labelled as **Base**) it will then apply the transformations which you have specified in the textbox at the top, the resulting colour will then appear on the right with the it's corresponding hex value. Example below.
